We will call the true solution \"stable\" in this case.  (Technically, there is a third possibility.  If $\\lambda = 0$, then $x(t)$ stays constant forever.

    "## Overview\n",
    "We only analyzed the stability of a very limited set of differential equations (the test problems) and we only looked at two methods (forward and backward Euler), but it turns out that this analysis applies to a wide variety of problems and methods.  More complicated differential equations don't usually just go to zero as time goes on, but we are still interested in correctly capturing whatever long term behavior they have.  We will say that the solution to a differential equation is \"stable\" if it does *not* go to infinity as time goes on.  (This is not a very good definition, but we would have to spend several classes on differential equations theory in order to make a substantially better one.)  It turns out that explicit approximation methods are prone to going to infinity even when the true solution is stable, while implicit methods are good at capturing stable behavior.  This means that explicit methods often need a fairly small time step $\\Delta t$ in order to correctly capture long-term stable behavior.  Implicit methods, on the other hand, can correctly capture long-term stable behavior even with a fairly large time step.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In real world applications, solutions rarely go to infinity.  For example, if we are modeling the population of a species, there are physical limits (like space or resource requirements) that keep this population from becoming infinitely large.  Because of this, we typically expect the true solution of our initial value problems to be stable.  This means that implicit methods like backward Euler can usually correctly capture long-term behavior with a larger time step than explicit methods like forward Euler.  We therefore say that implicit methods like backward Euler have \"better stability properties\" or are \"more stable\" than explicit methods.  "
